Simple helper module for Image Preview method for REST and GraphQL for immediate image preview on your client's side (Swift, Java, JavaScript and so on).

Idea is to deliver only around 200 bytes of image data as a normal base64 data in one of JSON fields of your entities and then issue request to obtain full resolution of an image.
